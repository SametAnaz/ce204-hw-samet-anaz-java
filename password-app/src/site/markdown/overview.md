Password Manager App

Secure Password Storage:
Your project aims to securely store users' passwords. Passwords are organized according to their respective accounts and, if applicable, stored in an encrypted format using appropriate encryption algorithms.

Password Generator:
Your project includes a feature that allows users to generate strong and unique passwords. Users can specify options such as desired length and complexity, resulting in passwords tailored to meet their security requirements.

Auto-Login Feature:
Users can configure an auto-login feature for specific accounts. With this feature enabled, the application automatically enters the necessary authentication credentials into the relevant website or application, simplifying the login process.
